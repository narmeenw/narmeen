            <h3>Animated Type Specimen</h3>
            <p>Created using Illustrator and After Effects</p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>This was a project where the brief was to design a typeface based on a chosen building. I chose Southwark Cathedral in London because it is an architecture style that is not common in Singapore and I thought it would be interesting to explore a new space and style. I used the curves of the stones and the stained-glass windows of the Cathedral as the basis of the design. The colours chosen for this project were given to us by our tutors and therefore I had to work with a restrictive guideline.
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>The typeface was designed on illustrator and then imported and edited on Glyphs.</p>
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>All the typefaces designed by the students of the year group was bound into a collaborative zine. The layout for this was done by the course reps, including me. </p>
